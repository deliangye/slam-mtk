	<briefdescription>
	  MTK is a toolkit that provides easy mechanisms to enable
	  arbitrary algorithms to operate on manifolds. The main
	  application is the use of 3D rotations SO(3), as well as the
	  construction of compound manifolds from arbitrary
	  combinations of sub-manifolds.

	  We also provide a refactored version of the previously
	  released SLoM framework which implements Gauss-Newton and
	  Levenberg-Marquardt-based sparse least-squares optimization
	  on manifolds and a port of MTK to Matlab (MTKM).
	</briefdescription>

	<description>
	  The main motivation for MTK was that many SLAM algorithms either
	  used (and partially still use) poor representations such as Euler
	  angles to represent 3D orientations running into problems with
	  singularities or overparameterize e.g. using Quaternions but
	  ignoring undetermined degrees of freedom.

	  Another advantage of MTK is that it provides macros to combine
	  elementary manifolds (such as R^n or SO(3)) to compund manifolds
	  providing a flattened view for generic algorithms, while the user
	  can access sub-components by name. Also functions are provided to
	  access submatrices of Covariances corresponding to components
	  of the state.

	  Compound manifolds are handled entirely using macros and template
	  code, thus causing no run-time overhead.

	  The Matlab port primarily targets calibration applications
	  and SLAM experimentation trading speed for ease of
	  use. Details can be found in the IROS paper below.
	</description>

	<requirement>
	  Developed under Linux (GCC). Tested under Linux and Windows.
	  MTK is a pure header-only template library depending on Boost
	  and the Eigen matrix library.
	  SLoM furthermore requires the CXSparse library.
	</requirement>

	<map>
	  MTK is only used to represent states. 
	  SLoM can operate on arbitrary feature based maps or calibration problems.
	</map>

	<input>
	  Input operations have to be implemented by the user.
	</input>

	<logformat>
	  For SLoM some examples are implemented working on logfiles as
	  provided by TORO, iSAM or HOG-Man.
	</logformat>

		<description>
		  Manifolds such as the sphere are viewed locally as Euclidean Space. 
		  Generic algorithms access the state only within the tangential space using the boxplus-operator.
